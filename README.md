A REST API for a real estate platform built with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE, JWT, Cloudinary, Flyway, Swagger, Docker Compose, and Postman.

The project started as a way to practice Java backend development with a more realistic structure than a simple CRUD. It includes authentication, role-based access, broker ownership rules, validation, file upload handling, database migrations, API documentation, and environment-based configuration.

## Project Status

- Backend API intended for portfolio use, with security, maintainability, and practical business rules in mind.
- Runs locally with Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Swagger UI, and Postman OAuth2 testing.
- Designed as a backend foundation for a future real estate marketplace frontend.

## Highlights

- OAuth2 Authorization Server with Authorization Code + PKCE
- JWT access tokens with custom `authorities` and `username` claims
- Resource Server protection for authenticated endpoints
- Role hierarchy where `ADMIN` includes `BROKER` permissions
- Broker ownership validation for property and image mutations
- Admin-only user management
- Public property catalog with filtering, sorting, pagination, and primary images
- Cloudinary integration for property image uploads and deletion
- Transactional rollback behavior for failed image uploads
- Flyway-managed PostgreSQL schema evolution
- Swagger UI configured with OAuth2 PKCE
- Postman collection and environment ready for token-based testing
- Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL health checks
- Automated tests covering validation, mapping, service behavior, ownership rules, and basic security access checks

## Domain Overview

The API models a real estate marketplace where public users can browse available properties, brokers can manage their own listings, and admins can manage users and view the full inventory.

Core domain concepts:

- `Property`: title, description, price, transaction type, category, area, room details, availability, address, broker owner, and images.
- `Image`: uploaded media linked to a property, including one primary image.
- `User`: authenticated account with `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_BROKER`.
- `Address`: structured address data with state and ZIP code normalization.

Supported property categories:

```text
APARTMENT, HOUSE, COMMERCIAL, LAND, STUDIO, FARM
```

Supported transaction types:

```text
SALE, RENT
```

The project follows a layered structure:

```text
src/main/java/com/mlcdev/realestate

|-- controller      # REST endpoints
|-- dto             # Request and response models

`-- validation      # Custom validation annotations
```

## Security Model

The API uses Spring Authorization Server and protects business endpoints as a JWT Resource Server.

### Authentication Flow

1. The user starts an OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.
2. The Authorization Server authenticates the user through Spring Security form login.
3. The client exchanges the authorization code plus PKCE verifier for tokens.
4. Protected requests send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
5. The Resource Server validates the JWT using the local JWKS endpoint.

### Roles

| Role          | Capabilities                                                                                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public        | List available properties, view property details, list property images, access health and OpenAPI docs    |
| `ROLE_BROKER` | Create properties, update own properties, upload images, set primary images, delete own properties/images |
| `ROLE_ADMIN`  | Inherits broker permissions, manages users, sees all properties, can act across broker-owned resources    |

### Authorization Details

- `ADMIN` implies `BROKER` through Spring Security role hierarchy.
- Access tokens include `authorities` and `username` claims.
- Broker mutations are checked against property ownership.
- Deactivating a user invalidates that user's persisted OAuth2 authorizations.
- Passwords are encoded with BCrypt.
- New user passwords must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.

GET /v1/properties?search=pool&transactionType=SALE&category=HOUSE&page=0&size=10&sort=price,asc
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 25
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Maven is optional because the project includes `mvnw`
- A Cloudinary account for real image uploads
- OpenSSL for generating local RSA keys

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatheusLeiteCarneiro/real-estate-api.git
cd real-estate-api
```

### 2. Create the environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values in `.env` according to your local environment. At minimum, configure PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, admin credentials, and the authorization server URL.

```env
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
POSTGRES_DB=realestate_db
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://your-api-key:your-api-secret@your-cloud-name
AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Generate local JWT keys

```bash
mkdir -p secrets
openssl genrsa -out secrets/app.key 2048
openssl rsa -in secrets/app.key -pubout -out secrets/app.pub
```

### 4. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Docker Compose starts:

- PostgreSQL 15
- The Spring Boot API
- A persistent `postgres_data` volume
- A health check before the API starts

### 5. Run locally with Maven

Start PostgreSQL separately, configure `.env`, then run:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application automatically loads `.env` values during startup.

## Swagger UI

Swagger UI is available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

The OpenAPI configuration includes an OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.

For local development, use:

```text
Client ID: swagger-client
Scopes: openid profile
```

The Swagger redirect URI is configured through:

```env
SWAGGER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/oauth2-redirect.html
```

## Postman

This repository includes:

```text
real-estate.postman_collection.json
real-estate.api.postman_environment.json
```

Recommended flow:

1. Import both files into Postman.
2. Select the `Real Estate - API` environment.
3. Update the credentials in the `Real Estate - API` environment.
4. Open the collection Authorization tab.
5. Confirm the grant type is `Authorization Code (With PKCE)`.
6. Click `Get New Access Token`.
7. Login with the configured admin credentials.
8. Click `Use Token`.

Protected requests inherit OAuth2 auth from the collection, so the `Authorization` header is generated by Postman.

## Useful Credentials for Local Development

The initial admin user is created from `.env`:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!
```

These are local development example credentials. Change them before running the project outside your machine.

## Database Migrations

Flyway manages the schema under:

```text
src/main/resources/db/migration
```

The migrations cover:

- Initial property and address schema
- Image metadata and primary image support
- User table and roles
- Broker-property ownership relationship
- Property enum/status refactors
- User timestamps
- OAuth2 authorization persistence schema

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

The current test structure includes coverage for:

- Application context
- Property mapping
- Property service behavior
- Broker ownership validation
- Strong password validation

## Example Request

Create a property as an authenticated broker or admin:

```http
POST /v1/properties
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "title": "Modern family house",
  "description": "Spacious property near schools, parks, and local shops.",
  "price": 750000.00,
  "transactionType": "SALE",
  "category": "HOUSE",
  "suites": 1,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bathrooms": 2,
  "area": 120.50,
  "parkingSpots": 2,
  "address": {
    "street": "Main Street",
    "number": "100",
    "complement": "Apartment 12",
    "neighborhood": "Downtown",
    "city": "Sample City",
    "state": "CA",
    "zipCode": "90000000"
  }
}
```
